> A flexible, or "liquid," approach to page layout attempts to accommodate the diversity of display environments. Rather than serving only the "most common" display dimensions and the "typical" user, a flexible layout adapts to different viewing conditions and different user requirements.





# Float
The float CSS property locates the elements on the left or right side of their containers, which alllows text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

The float property can have one of the following values:

none 

inherit 


# Grid
CSS Grid allows us to write better layouts using the in-browser capability of grids. Prior to CSS Grid, we either had to use our own custom grid system or something like Bootstrap.
