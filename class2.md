# jQuery

jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.

When a browser renders a web page, it's a visual representation of what's known as the DOM (or the document object model). This model can be conceptually modeled as a tree data structure where there are certain nodes each with roots and leaves.
