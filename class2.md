# jQuery

jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.

When a browser renders a web page, it's a visual representation of what's known as the DOM (or the document object model). This model can be conceptually modeled as a tree data structure where there are certain nodes each with roots and leaves.

# jQuery Dom

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a mechanism for representing and interacting with your HTML, XHTML or XML documents. It allows you to navigate and manipulate your documents through a programming language, which in the browser will almost always be JavaScript. DOM navigation and manipulation using standard JavaScript can be pretty cumbersome,  jQuery provides DOM related methods, which make the process much easier.
